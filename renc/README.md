These files have been tested with ren-c build a926dd6 (8-Mar-2017/6:11:52) on Windows64.  You can download the binaries for Ren-c 
at http://metaeducation.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

**Use**

The primary use of the Rebol Hue Bridge is to control LimitlessLED/MiBulbs/Easybulbs through the WiFi bridge, but it can also be used to trigger scripts on a PC (Windows/Linux) without using IFTTT.  However, it could be configured to use IFTTT if you open up the HTTP port to the outside.  At present we don't have any security enabled for this but it's easy enough to add.

I will of course attempt to make sure that it runs with later versions as well.

**To Run**
Download a ren-c binary and all these scripts.  In the same directory, just run

r3-buildno bridge.reb

**Configuration**
You'll have to make some configuration changes which will be documented soon. 
More likely a separate file will hold all the user config settings.

**DEMO**
